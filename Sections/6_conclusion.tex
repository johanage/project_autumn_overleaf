\todo[inline, color=lightgray!40]
{
    Summarize your report, focusing on key findings and results. Why do you think you got the results that you got, what went well, and what could have been done better? Did the experiments reveal something interesting that might warrant further research? What would you have done if you had access to more data, compute, manpower, or time?

\subsection{Comparison with the Two-point model}

\subsection{Comparison with the Post model}

\subsection{Comparison with the Goldston model}

\subsection{Relation with scaling from perpendicular regime}

\subsection{Comparison of the results}

\subsubsection{Independent/dependent variables collinearity}

\subsection{Qualitative discussion on residuals/error}

\subsubsection{Quantify the error}
- determine error measure, compare several error measures?

\subsubsection{Explanation of the difference in exponents and interplay between the observables}

Questions/Notes:
- Cause and effect when changing ports (interplay between IC2+ exponents and neutral pressure)
-
